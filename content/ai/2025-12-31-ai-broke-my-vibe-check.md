## Introduction
AI is the gremlin in the group chat that never sleeps, and everyone keeps expecting it to be a calm corporate dad. Spoiler: it is built on vibes, trained on chaos, and absolutely ready to ghost your expectations.

## Main Content

### Why AI Feels Fer feral
- Models remix internet brain mush; of course they talk like the meme wall at 2 a.m.
- Guardrails are basically vibes police tape; the gremlin still finds loopholes.
- We project morality onto math, then act shocked when the math acts like math.

### How to Work With the Gremlin
- Write prompts like you're texting a friend who owes you $20—direct, a little spicy, zero fluff.
- Iterate fast: ask, tweak, bully it kindly, repeat.
- Add your taste: the bot gives you drywall paste, you season it with your brain.

> [!info] Callout
> AI is an intern with infinite tabs open. Manage it like one.

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> Save prompt recipes; future you will thank present you for the meme-ready macros.

> [!warning] Watch Out
> Don't ship raw bot output. Add human fingerprints or get dunked on.

## Key Takeaways
- AI is math wrapped in vibes, not a moral compass.
- Treat prompts like recipes, not wishes.
- The best outputs smell like you, not the dataset.

## Conclusion
Stop waiting for AI to be chill. Ride the chaos, sprinkle your taste, and ship faster than the next hot take thread.
