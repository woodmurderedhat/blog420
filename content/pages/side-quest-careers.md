## Why Side Quests Matter
Main jobs feel like main quests until the boss nerfs your pay. Side quests give you XP, leverage, and a backup portal.

## Build Your Skill Tree
- Pick one monetizable skill you can demo in 30 days.
- Ship tiny projects weekly; screenshots are your resume now.
- Price by outcomes, not hours. Charge for the dragon, not the sword swings.

## Keep Burnout Away
- Timebox fiercely: 2 focused nights, not 7 scattered ones.
- Reuse templates and SOPs; future you deserves autopilot.
- Rest like it's a deliverable. No rest, no crit hits.

## Quick Wins to Try
- Micro SaaS with nocode and a Stripe link.
- Ghostwrite spicy newsletters for execs who can't meme.
- Template packs, icon sets, or mini-courses under 60 minutes.

## Closing
Treat your life like an RPG: stack skills, farm XP, and keep your inventory light. The boss fight is optional when you can portal out.
