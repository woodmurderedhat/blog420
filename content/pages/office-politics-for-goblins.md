## Read the Room
- Map the power grid: who actually ships, who just forwards emails.
- Identify your quest-givers: the few who unblock you fast.

## Play the Game, Lightly
- Document everything; meeting notes are your shield.
- Under-promise, over-deliver, meme responsibly in Slack.
- Build alliances with ops and IT—they are the real wizards.

## Protect Your Energy
- Decline zombie meetings; propose async updates instead.
- Set boundaries: "No" is a feature, not a bug.
- Celebrate wins in public; receipts are armor.

## Escalation Protocol
- When drama sparks, stick to facts and timestamps.
- If you're the only adult in the room, keep it short and send a recap.

## Closing
Corporate dungeons are beatable. Stay sharp, stay kind, and keep your exit portal bookmarked.
