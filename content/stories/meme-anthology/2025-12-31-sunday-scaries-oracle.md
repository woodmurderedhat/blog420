## Setup

Sunday night. Laptop glaring. To-do list multiplying like gremlins in a dishwasher. I light a candle that smells like "productivity" (just citrus and lies).

## Prophecy

- First card: "Inbox Zero"—reversed. Laughs in 347 unread.
- Second card: "Meeting That Could've Been An Email"—upright. Of course.
- Third card: "Plot Twist"—a friend texts: "Brunch tomorrow?" Hope appears.

## Ending

I close the laptop, set alarms, and trust the oracle. Monday will still be a boss fight, but at least I'll have pancakes first.
