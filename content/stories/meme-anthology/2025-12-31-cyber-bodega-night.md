## Scene
Neon drips off the awning. The bodega cat has LED whiskers. I'm here for instant ramen and a battery for my mood ring.

## Beats
- The fridge hums like a low-poly dragon. I grab the chili flavor because self-respect is expensive.
- Clerk asks, "Cash or crypto?" I say "vibes" and tap my wrist chip. It declines. Twice.
- I trade a meme NFT for a portable charger. The cat approves, tail flick glowing cyan.

## Exit
I leave with ramen, a charged phone, and a neon sticker that says "Bad Decisions, Great Stories." Worth it.
