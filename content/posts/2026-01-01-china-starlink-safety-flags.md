## Introduction

At a UN meeting, Chinese reps warned that Starlink satellites pose "safety and security" risks after near-miss incidents, per South China Morning Post (SCMP). Space traffic is getting crowded and political.

## Main Content

### What Beijing Told the UN

- Cited near-miss events involving Starlink; urged tighter coordination and oversight.
- Framed mega-constellations as dual-use risks—commercial plus potential military value.
- Called for clearer norms on collision avoidance and data sharing.

### Broader Context

- Low Earth orbit is filling fast; debris and conjunction risks keep climbing.
- US-China space rivalry extends to comms, ISR, and launch markets.
- Regulators globally are still catching up to mega-constellation scale.

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> Space-adjacent startups: track ITU filings and national licensing changes; collision rules may tighten and raise compliance costs.

> [!warning] Watch Out
> Expect more geopolitical framing around satellite data access and emergency maneuver protocols.

## Key Takeaways

- China is publicly challenging Starlink's risk profile at multilateral forums.
- Collision-avoidance standards and transparency are likely flashpoints in 2026.
- Satellite operators should prepare for stricter disclosure and coordination demands.

## Conclusion

Space norms lag the launch cadence. Watch UN and ITU follow-ups to see if rhetoric turns into new guardrails for mega-constellations.
