## Key Takeaways

- Historic first for NYC politics and representation.
- Policy focus: housing, transit reliability, and accountability.
- Budget negotiations will make or break the ambition.

## Conclusion

Symbolism was strong, but delivery will live in the subway schedules and rent receipts. The next few months tell us if this is a vibe shift or just a headline.
