## Introduction
Cape Town finally put a sticker price on its sewage crisis: around R12bn for the long-term fix, per News24. Beaches, ratepayer bills, and timelines are all on the line.

## Main Content

### What the City Says
- Multi-year plan aimed at upgrading plants and pipelines; details pending council sign-off.
- Early focus: hotspots that keep triggering beach closures and public anger.
- Funding mix: municipal budget, possible national grants, maybe private partnerships.

### Why It Matters
- Tourism and surf culture hate recurring sewage spills; coastal closures hit jobs and local business.
- Environmental regulators are tightening; non-compliance fines and court orders are on the table.
- Load-shedding complicates plant uptime; backup power costs get baked into the bill.

## Key Takeaways
- R12bn signals scale and urgency; execution risk stays high.
- Clean beaches are an economic asset; delays tax tourism and health.
- Power reliability remains the hidden cost driver for wastewater plants.

## Conclusion
The number is finally public; now the clock starts on shovels and procurement. Track council timelines and the first wave of project tenders.
