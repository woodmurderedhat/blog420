## Introduction

As of today, Bulgaria is in the eurozone. Years of delays over inflation targets and banking alignment finally ended, and leva notes just became souvenirs.

## Main Content

### What Changes Today

- Euro becomes legal tender; dual pricing will stick around for the transition window.
- ATMs, online banking, and POS systems are swapping over; expect some hiccups.
- Salaries and contracts convert at the fixed rate; check your invoices.

### Who Wins, Who Worries

- Tourism gets simpler—no more exchange friction for EU visitors.
- Exporters gain from reduced FX risk; small shops may stress over repricing and fees.
- Inflation hawks watching closely; price rounding during transitions can spike receipts.

> Official conversion rate: 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN. Anything else is a bad deal.

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> Visiting soon? Use cards from large banks; smaller ATMs may lag in firmware updates during the first week.

> [!warning] Watch Out
> Scammers love currency switchovers. Verify notes and receipts, and avoid "exclusive" street exchange offers.

## Key Takeaways

- Bulgaria is now eurozone country number 21.
- Short-term friction likely in payments; long-term FX stability improves trade.
- Inflation data over Q1 will be the honesty test for the transition.

## Conclusion

Smooth transitions are rare but possible. If Bulgaria keeps payment rails steady and tames rounding creep, this could be a clean entry. Watch January receipts and February inflation prints.
