## Introduction
In his New Year address, Ukraine's President Zelensky claimed a peace deal is "90% ready." Russia's Putin responded with a promise of victory to troops. The war enters year four with dueling narratives.

## Main Content

### What Zelensky Said
- Talks are ongoing with unnamed partners; framing: most terms agreed, final hurdles remain.
- Aim: security guarantees and reconstruction cash alongside ceasefire terms.

### What Moscow Said
- Putin's message leaned on resolve and "inevitable" victory, signaling no public shift toward compromise.
- Domestic framing stays militant; no hint of concessions.

### How to Read the Gap
- 90% could mean text alignment, or just that the hardest 10% (security guarantees, territorial status) is unresolved.
- Allies likely pressuring for de-escalation to stabilize energy and grain routes.

> [!info] Callout
> "Near-finished" deals often stall on verification, timelines, and who guarantees what. Watch for details on monitors and enforcement.

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> For business planning: hedge logistics on Black Sea and rail corridors; sudden announcements can swing insurance and rates.

> [!warning] Watch Out
> Disinformation spikes around peace-talk headlines. Cross-check sources before resharing maps or draft terms.

## Key Takeaways
- Publicly, Kyiv signals optimism; Moscow signals resolve—gap still wide.
- The remaining 10% likely covers territory, security guarantees, and enforcement.
- Markets and supply chains will react to any verified framework drop.

## Conclusion
Until specific terms surface, treat the "90%" line as positioning. The real tell will be third-party verification mechanisms and whether frontline activity cools in January.
