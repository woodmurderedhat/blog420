Everything is easy now.  
That was the promise.

One click.  
One swipe.  
One tap and it's done.

Food arrives without hunger building.  
Images appear without making.  
People enter your life without effort  
and leave the same way.

Nothing resists you anymore.

## Ease Was Supposed to Feel Better Than This

We removed friction.  
We streamlined.  
We optimized.

And somehow everything feels thinner.  
Less dense.  
Like it passes through you  
without landing.

Pleasure arrives too quickly.  
So it doesn't register.  
Achievement shows up pre-chewed.  
So it doesn't stick.

You get what you want  
before you finish wanting it.

## Friction Used to Mean Something

Waiting mattered.  
Struggle shaped attachment.

When something took time  
it accumulated weight.  
Mistakes stayed visible.  
Effort left marks.

Now outcomes detach from process.  
You can have the result  
without inhabiting the work.

And without the work  
there is nothing to remember.

## Automation Is Tiring in a New Way

Not exhausting.  
Numbing.

You don't fight the system.  
You float inside it.

Decisions disappear.  
So does responsibility.  
So does satisfaction.

The machine handles everything  
except meaning.

That part was always yours.  
No one warned you.

## Care Cannot Be Compressed

Care takes time.  
Attention.  
Presence.

Convenience replaces all three  
with speed.

A meal made instantly  
is still food  
but it doesn't carry the same signal.

A message sent automatically  
still communicates  
but it doesn't hold you.

Ease mimics care  
without practicing it.

## Nothing Is Hard and Nothing Is Deep

Creative tools remove resistance.  
So creation becomes abundant  
and oddly empty.

Dating apps remove barriers.  
So people become interchangeable.

Everything is accessible.  
Nothing is precious.
