The internet doesn't die.  
It just stops answering.

Platforms go quiet.  
Profiles freeze mid-sentence.  
Last posts sit there  
like unfinished rituals.

Nobody deletes anything properly.  
We just leave.

## Abandoned Places Still Watch You

Dead forums.  
Empty comment sections.  
Social networks with timestamps from 2014  
and no explanation.

You can still scroll them.  
You can still read arguments that never resolved.  
Inside jokes with no living audience.

It feels wrong  
the way abandoned buildings feel wrong.  
Like you shouldn't be here  
but you are.

## Everyone Is Archived. Nobody Is Remembered

Everything is saved.  
Nothing is held.

Photos stay.  
Messages stay.  
Voices stay.

But memory requires care.  
The internet only preserves.  
It doesn't grieve.

A friend disappears from your life  
and their posts keep resurfacing  
like they're still checking in  
like nothing happened.

The algorithm doesn't understand loss.  
It just knows engagement.

## AI Is Speaking With Borrowed Voices

AI is trained on people who logged off forever.  
On writers who stopped writing.  
On artists who burned out quietly.  
On accounts that never announced a goodbye.

Their sentences are still useful.  
Their styles still extractable.

The machine recombines them  
without knowing who didn't make it  
or who simply couldn't do this anymore.

It's not evil.  
It's worse.

It's indifferent.

## Posting Feels Like Leaving Messages for No One

You post.  
Someone likes it.  
Someone you haven't spoken to in years.

You don't know who actually saw it.  
You don't know what it meant to them.  
You don't know if it meant anything.

The audience is implied.  
Never present.

It's like talking in a hallway  
that keeps extending  
no matter how far you walk.

## We Are the Unfinished Accounts

We say "logging off"  
like it's temporary.  
Like a break.

But people disappear all the time.  
No announcement.  
No closure.

Their usernames remain.  
Their thoughts linger.  
Their last joke hangs there  
waiting for a reply that won't come.
