## Introduction
Instant ramen is the Spotify shuffle of meals: chaotic, underrated, weirdly comforting. Let's upscale it without dirtying every pan you own.

## Main Content

### Upgrades That Slap
- Add fat: spoon of peanut butter or a glug of sesame oil.
- Add crunch: crushed chips, roasted peanuts, or leftover veggies.
- Add protein: egg drop, tofu cubes, rotisserie chicken scraps.

### Ritual for the Broke Gourmet
- Microwave broth separate so noodles stay springy.
- Season like you're DJing: taste, tweak, drop the packet last.
- Plate it in a nice bowl; Instagram is watching.

> [!warning] Watch Out
> Don't boil noodles into mush. Timer on, pride intact.

## Key Takeaways
- Cheap food can taste premium with tiny tweaks.
- Texture + fat + acid = happy bowl.
- Presentation is half the meal in the meme era.

## Conclusion
Respect the noodle. Upgrade the basics, flex on your timeline, and keep the sink empty.
