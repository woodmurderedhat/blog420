Everyone is exhausted.  
Not sleepy.  
Not overworked in a cute way.

Worn down.  
Like something has been rubbing for years  
and never stopped.

We keep calling it burnout  
like it's a temporary condition.  
Like a long weekend and a scented candle could fix it.

It can't.

## This Isn't an Individual Failure

You didn't mismanage your energy.  
You didn't forget to self-care hard enough.  
You didn't optimize incorrectly.

You are reacting normally  
to a world that never shuts the fuck up.

There is always a notification.  
Always an update.  
Always something you are behind on  
even when you are doing everything asked of you.

The tiredness is structural.

## Rest Has Become Suspicious

If you stop  
someone asks why.

If you slow down  
you feel guilty.

If you say you're tired  
you apologize immediately  
like exhaustion is a character flaw.

Rest is framed as reward.  
Or recovery.  
Something you earn after damage.

Never as a baseline.  
Never as a right.

So people keep going  
past sensible  
past safe  
past kind.

## We Are Functioning, Not Living

Days blur.  
Weeks vanish.

You complete tasks  
but nothing settles.

You consume content  
but it doesn't nourish.  
You sleep  
but you don't arrive anywhere rested.

Life feels like maintenance mode.  
Keeping systems from crashing.  
Nothing more.

And somehow this is called normal.

## Motivation Culture Is Lying to You

They tell you to push through.  
To reframe.  
To grind gently.  
To hustle but mindfully.

All of it assumes the problem is attitude.

It isn't.

You can't mindset your way out  
of a pace designed to extract until failure.

## The Quiet Grief

There is grief here.  
Unacknowledged.

Grief for energy you used to have.  
For attention that could sit still.  
For enthusiasm that wasn't immediately rationed.

Nobody marks this loss.  
So it leaks out sideways.
