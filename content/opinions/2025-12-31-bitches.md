## okay LISTEN UP because i have THOUGHTS

so its new years eve and im sitting here scrolling through the news like some kind of masochist and HOLY SHIT when did everything become a dumpster fire wrapped in a tire fire inside a porta-potty thats also on fire???

like. LIKE. the geopolitics rn are absolutely UNHINGED. every country is beefing with every other country. trade wars here. actual wars there. politicians lying like its an olympic sport (spoiler: they'd all get gold medals). climate stuff getting worse but sure lets argue about it for another decade while the planet literally cooks us like rotisserie chickens.

> [!warning] real talk for 0.5 seconds
> im genuinely worried about the state of global affairs but also im three drinks in so we're processing this through VIBES ONLY

## BUT WAIT THERES MORE (and its actually kinda sick)

you know what IS popping off though???? TECH. oh my GOD tech is going absolutely bonkers bananas in the best way possible.

like we got:
- AI that can write code better than my drunk ass (not a high bar rn tbh)
- quantum computers doing shit i dont even understand but it SOUNDS cool
- fusion energy actually making progress (FINALLY)
- space x launching rockets like theyre going out of style
- some nerd probably invented teleportation in their garage while i was typing this

### the absolute DUALITY of it all

so like. politicians cant agree on ANYTHING. the UN is basically a group chat where everyone left read receipts on. half the world is mad at the other half for reasons that change daily.

BUT ALSO

some 23 year old just revolutionized battery technology in their stanford dorm. we got robot dogs doing backflips. crypto is doing... something (idk im not brave enough for that volatility). AR/VR is actually getting good enough that i might never leave my house again.

==THE WORLD IS ENDING BUT THE TECH IS ABSOLUTELY SENDING IT==

> [!tip] survival strategy for 2026
> just focus on the robot dogs and ignore the everything else lmao

## the vibe check has FAILED but also SUCCEEDED???

here's the thing about 2025 that absolutely breaks my brain:

we're living in this WILD timeline where:
1. global institutions are crumbling like old cookies
2. social media made everyone insane (myself included clearly)
3. the news cycle is just trauma on a loop
4. nobody trusts anyone anymore
5. everything costs 10000% more than it did yesterday

BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY:
1. medical tech is curing diseases left and right
2. renewable energy finally getting that GLOW UP
3. automation making life actually easier (when its not stealing jobs rip)
4. information is basically free (misinformation also free unfortunately)
5. we're literally living in the FUTURE our childhood selves dreamed about

like how do i process this???? how am i supposed to feel existential dread about geopolitics while also being HYPED about the new GPU architecture???

## my unhinged take that nobody asked for

*slams drink on table*

you know what? FUCK IT. yeah the worlds a mess. yeah politicians are clowns. yeah we're probably headed for some cyberpunk dystopia where corporations run everything.

but you know what else? WE GOT ROBOTS DOING SURGERY. we got kids learning to code at 8. we got open source communities building better stuff than billion dollar companies. we got HACKERS and MAKERS and BUILDERS who dont give a SHIT about the political theater.

the tech boom is proof that while the old guard argues about whose fault everything is, the nerds are out here BUILDING THE FUTURE.

> [!info] controversial opinion incoming
> maybe the fact that tech is thriving DESPITE the political shitshow means we dont need politicians as much as they think we do???

## anyway heres my new years resolution

im gonna:
- learn rust (everyones learning rust apparently)
- build some shit with AI
- touch grass at least twice a month
- stop doomscrolling (starting tomorrow)
- appreciate that even though everything is terrible, we live in a time where i can yell into the void and someone on the other side of the planet reads it instantly

thats MAGIC yo. thats the FUTURE. 

yeah politicians suck. yeah global affairs are a nightmare. yeah we're all gonna die someday.

but FIRST we're gonna see what happens when AGI drops. or when fusion becomes commercial. or when we finally get those flying cars.

## conclusion (if you can call it that)

look. 2025 was a TRIP. politics? trash. geopolitics? dumpster fire. social cohesion? never heard of her.

but TECH? tech said "hold my energy drink" and just kept INNOVATING through the chaos.

so heres to 2026. may it be less of a shitshow politically. may the tech boom continue. may my code compile on the first try (lmao jk thats never happening).

happy new year you beautiful disasters. lets build some cool shit and try not to let the world burn down around us.

*passes out on keyboard*
