## Introduction

Crypto is a group project where everyone wants an A but half the team is shitposting on X. The only constant is vibes and screenshots of wallets.

## Main Content

### The Vibe Economy

- Tokenomics = storytelling with spreadsheets and hopium.
- Community is ninety percent memes, ten percent governance proposals nobody reads.
- Rug pulls are just aggressive unsubscribes.

### Survival Kit

- Never marry a coin; date casually, set alarms, use a stop-loss.
- If the Discord has more lasers than docs, walk away.
- Take profits; screenshots of your paper gains don't pay rent.

## Key Takeaways

- Crypto runs on memes, momentum, and receipts.
- Protect your stack with rules, not hope.
- Community energy matters, but so does liquidity.

## Conclusion

Play the game, don't get played. Ride the hype waves, cash out before the undertow, and keep your wallet keys far from sketchy links.
