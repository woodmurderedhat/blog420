## Introduction

You don't need a trust fund to collect stamps. You need flexible dates, comfy shoes, and a tolerance for weird snacks.

## Main Content

### The Scrappy Playbook

- Fly on Tuesdays, stalk price alerts, accept layovers as mini side quests.
- Hostels with lockers are fine; bring earplugs and call it ambiance.
- Eat street food where locals line up; skip the tourist trap smoothies.

### Staying Sane-ish

- Two outfits, one laundry soap sheet, zero checked bags.
- Offline maps and downloaded playlists save your ass when Wi-Fi ghosts you.
- Say hi to strangers; most are friendly, some are weird, all are stories.

## Key Takeaways

- Flexibility beats luxury for budget trips.
- Pack light, move fast, stay curious.
- Stories live in the misadventures.

## Conclusion

Book the flight, embrace the chaos, and collect memories, not airport lounge selfies.
