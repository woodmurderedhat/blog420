Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is a sample post that demonstrates how the blog works.

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a markdown file to the `_posts` directory with the filename format:

```
_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md
```

## Post Front Matter

Every post should start with YAML front matter like this:

```yaml

layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-12-30
author: Your Name
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
excerpt: "A brief excerpt that shows on the home page"
---
```

## Features

This blog includes several features:

- **Automatic Indexing**: Posts are automatically sorted by date and displayed on the homepage
- **Tagging System**: Organize posts by tags, and view all posts with a specific tag
- **Archive**: Browse all posts organized by year
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Just push to GitHub and your site is automatically deployed!

## Writing Posts

You can write posts in regular markdown:

### Headers work as expected

Here's a list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

You can add **bold**, *italics*, and `inline code`.

Code blocks work too:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Next Steps

1. Edit `_config.yml` to customize your blog title, description, and author
2. Delete this sample post when ready
3. Create your first real post
4. Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings

Happy blogging!
