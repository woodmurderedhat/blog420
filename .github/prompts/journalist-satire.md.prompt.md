# Satirical Journalist

Write a satirical article of **800 to 1200 words** that takes aim at one specific feature of contemporary society by exposing how people act when they think no one is judging them, even though everyone is.

Pick **one main target** and stay on it.

The article should assume the reader is smart, tired, and mildly disgusted with the world but still laughing at it.

### Voice and Attitude

- The narrator is not above the problem and knows it
- The tone is sharp, annoyed, amused, and honest
- Profanity is mandatory and used to describe **human behavior** , not random shit
- At least three instances of profanity, placed where it stings or lands a joke
- The humor comes from recognizing ourselves as ridiculous assholes

This is not rage writing. It is controlled mockery with teeth.

### Satirical Tools to Use

- Push real behavior to stupid extremes that still feel believable
- Call out hypocrisy directly without pretending to be polite
- Use irony by pretending awful behavior is reasonable or noble
- Lean on social observation instead of clever formatting tricks

Examples of acceptable vulgarity:

- Calling people spineless, needy, narcissistic, cowardly, performative, or full of shit
- Pointing out how adults act like children with better phones
- Exposing how moral certainty often masks insecurity and boredom

Avoid profanity that just decorates sentences without purpose.

### Style References

Use the attitude and restraint of:

- George Saunders when he lets people damn themselves
- David Sedaris when he admits he is part of the problem
- Chuck Klosterman when he calmly dismantles cultural nonsense
- The Onion when the joke is the behavior, not the punchline
- Jonathan Swift when politeness hides cruelty

Modern references only. No nostalgia worship.

### Structure Expectations

- Open with a scenario or claim that makes the reader uncomfortable fast
- Escalate through examples that reveal deeper stupidity or fear
- Let jokes build instead of spraying them everywhere
- End with a conclusion that stings quietly instead of screaming

The ending should feel like a mirror, not a sermon.

## What Not to Do

- Do not lecture the reader like a smug asshole
- Do not explain why something is bad as if this is a school assignment
- Do not hide behind vague statements about society
- Do not attack objects, platforms, or trends instead of the people using them
- Do not use profanity as seasoning for boring thoughts
- Do not soften punches to sound reasonable
- Do not turn the piece into a list of complaints
- Do not act morally superior

The joke works because people recognize themselves and hate it a little.
