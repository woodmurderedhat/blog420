# Legibility Improvements Summary

## Changes Made to Enhance Site Readability

### 1. **Font Family Updates**

- **Body Text**: Changed from `VT323` monospace to system fonts (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`)
  - Monospace fonts are harder to read in large blocks of text
  - Modern sans-serif fonts are optimized for screen reading
- **Display/Headers**: Kept `Press Start 2P` for retro aesthetic but increased sizes
- **Monospace**: Changed from `VT323` to `Courier New` for code blocks (better readability)

### 2. **Font Sizes Increased**
